    description: "\"Design is everywhere, inevitably everyone is a designer,\" says Tim Brown of IDEO. That's something we've heard time and time again.

    description: "A portfolio site for a UX professional, though, is unique because it's both. For UX and UI designers, your website is more than just descriptions of your work - it is your work.
